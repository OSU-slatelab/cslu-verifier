# CSLU kids speech verificiation

This system implements a recognizer-based verification system.

To train a model using this, first make sure SpeechBrain is installed via pip.
This will change when the toolkit is released soon, but for now it can be installed
from test PyPI using the following command:

```
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple BeechSprain
```

Next, ensure you have access to the CSLU kids speech repository, say in `/path/to/cslu_kids`

You can run an experiment with:

```
cd verification/train
python train.py hparams/train.yaml --data_folder /path/to/cslu_kids
```

The different loss terms listed in `hparams/train.yaml` can be used to train a model for different tasks.

```yaml
...
ctc_weight: 0.0
align_weight: 0.0
verify_weight: 1.0
...
```

The ctc and align weight (together) can be used to train a system with reasonable alignments
between evidence and posterior, as outlined in [1].

The verify weight can be used to train a model to make predictions about whether each
utterance has an anomaly, based on the recording quality labels provided in the CSLU data.
